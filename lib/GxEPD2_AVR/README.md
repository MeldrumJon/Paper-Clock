# GxEPD2_AVR
Simplified Version of GxEPD for AVR Arduino

## for SPI e-paper displays from Dalian Good Display 
## and SPI e-paper boards from Waveshare

### important note :
### - these displays are for 3.3V supply and 3.3V data lines
### - never connect data lines directly to 5V Arduino data pins, you may use e.g. 4k7 series resistor


### Paged Drawing, Picture Loop
#### - This library uses paged drawing to cope with RAM restriction and missing single pixel update support
#### - Paged drawing is implemented as picture loop, like in U8G2 (Oliver Kraus)
#### - see https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib/wiki/tpictureloop

### Version 1.0.6
- added GxEPD2_AVR_SD_BitmapExample
- Support for Bitmaps (Sprites) to Controller Buffer and to Screen
- the bitmaps can reside in RAM or ROM, parameter pgm, default RAM
- origin x and width should be multiple of 8, are rounded down
- cropping to screen dimensions is handled
- allows tiled drawing for bitmaps from SD, SPIFFS or WiFi download
- use e.g. writeImage(...) for each tile, followed by refresh() for all
#### Version 1.0.2
- additional font support, e.g. from https://github.com/olikraus/U8g2_for_Adafruit_GFX
#### Version 1.0.1
- Example Bitmaps & 4.2" b/w fast partial update
