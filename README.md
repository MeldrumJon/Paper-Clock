**TODO:**
- Redesign using [Badgy](https://github.com/sqfmi/badgy) as a starting point.
- Replace ATMega with an ESP8266 to drive the screen and get time through an NTP server.
- Redesign enclosure to be much smaller and less expensive.
- If possible, try to make the clock battery-powered.

## Components

- [Enclosure](./3D)
